# Cafena Café Website Redesign and AWS Deployment Demonstration

## Abstract

This project presents the redesign of the Cafena Café website alongside the migration of its hosting infrastructure from a local cloud provider to Amazon Web Services (AWS). The objective is to improve performance, availability, scalability, and cost efficiency by adopting a cloud-native, serverless architecture. The solution utilises AWS S3 for static website hosting, CloudFront for content delivery, Route 53 for domain management, IAM for access control, and CloudWatch for basic monitoring. The project evaluates technical and financial implications and demonstrates the suitability of AWS for small-to-medium business web workloads.

## 1. Introduction

Cafena Café is a locally established business that has expanded into a regional operation through continuous innovation and service improvement. As the business grew, limitations in the existing website infrastructure became more apparent, particularly in terms of scalability, reliability, and operational cost.

This project aims to redesign the Cafena Café website and modernise its hosting infrastructure using AWS services. The focus is on providing a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution that supports current needs while remaining adaptable to future digital expansion.

## 2. Problem Statement

The existing hosting environment presented several challenges:

* Performance degradation during peak traffic periods
* Limited scalability combined with fixed and inflexible pricing
* Inconsistent availability and uptime
* Difficulty integrating advanced cloud services

These challenges negatively impacted both user experience and operational efficiency.

## 3. Business and Technical Impact

### 3.1 Hosting Model Comparison

| Factor            | AWS (S3)    | Local Cloud Provider | On-Premises             |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Monthly cost      | Near $0     | Fixed monthly fee    | Fixed + operating costs |
| Pricing model     | Usage-based | Fixed plan           | Capital + maintenance   |
| Scalability       | Automatic   | Plan-based           | Manual                  |
| HTTPS             | Automatic   | Varies               | Complex                 |
| Maintenance       | None        | Minimal              | High                    |
| Disaster recovery | Built-in    | Limited              | Manual                  |

The comparison highlights AWS as the most cost-effective and scalable solution for a static website workload.

## 5. AWS Architecture and Implementation

### 5.1 Services Used

| Requirement       | AWS Service | Purpose                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Website hosting   | Amazon S3   | Static website hosting and asset storage  |
| Domain management | Route 53    | Custom domain configuration               |
| Content delivery  | CloudFront  | Global caching and reduced latency        |
| Access control    | IAM         | Secure identity and permission management |
| Monitoring        | CloudWatch  | Basic metrics and operational visibility  |

## 6. Cost Analysis

### 6.1 Monthly Cost Scenarios (ZAR)

| Scenario                   | Monthly Cost | Notes                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| S3 only                    | R0           | Replacement for local static hosting |
| S3 + CloudFront            | R0           | Improved performance and caching     |
| S3 + CloudFront + Route 53 | ~R10 – R20   | Custom domain support                |
| CloudWatch                 | R0           | Optional monitoring                  |

**Estimated Monthly Cost:** **~R9.50 – R19.00**

### 6.2 Cost Justification

* Route 53 hosted zone: **$0.50/month ≈ R9.50**
* Minor DNS query charges may increase the total marginally
* Domain registration (**≈ $12/year ≈ R228/year**) is billed annually

This represents a significant reduction compared to fixed-cost local cloud hosting.
